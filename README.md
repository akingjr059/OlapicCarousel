# OlapicCarousel
Final carousel for Olapic Technical Problem Case

First thing I had to do was get git on my computer, so I installed that, as well as github for windows.  I also learned some of the commands for the windows command line in case I needed to use that.

Then I looked for beginner code snippets for carousels using .js, and found one pretty quickly.

I used microsoft expression web 4 to edit and preview my code, and then took some of the snippets to test the carousel.

After looking at a few plugins, I decided it would be better to just add the features of the carousel one by one from the ground up.  Plugins had a lot of extra things that I didn't really need and overcomplicated the process.

I ended up figuring out how to show 6 pictures at once after spending some time building and formatting the css file. 

After that, I tried to get the RESTful API media assets, but that didn't seem to work.  I may have been coding the request incorrectly, so I commented out that code.  

Then I decided to use the Chrome Advanced RESTlet Client to test the calls in a more structured environment. I was able to figure out how to construct the URL that I needed properly so that I could reference the dummy customer.

After that I had some trouble figuring out how to properly reference the links that were being returned in the JSON response.  So I took a look at StackOverflow and asked around about how to properly reference this type of response.
